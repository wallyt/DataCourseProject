# Overview
This code book covers the tidy data that is generated by run\_analysis.R, based on the UCI HAR data set. The original data set was composed of the measurements of activity trackers (Samsung Galaxy SII smartphones) worn by 30 subjects, broken into two groups, "test" and "train." For each subject, activity was classified as one of six actions: WALKING, WALKING\_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING. For each combination of subject and activity, 561 values were captured based on triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer, angular velocity from the gyroscope, time and frequency. Additional details on the raw data can be found at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

# Input and process
The data read in by run\_analysis.R are the raw data from the UCI HAR test. Using the steps outlined in the [README.md](https://github.com/wallyt/DataCourseProject/blob/master/README.md) document, run\_analysis does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Output
The output of the function is a text file named "set_cast.txt" that is a tidy data set with the average for each variable for each activity and subject. Each measured and calculated variable has its own column, each different observation of that variable has its own row and every variable in this table is related to each other (ie, additional tables not needed).

The column headers are:
* Test_Subject, which are the integers 1-30, representing one of the 30 subjects taking part in the original experiment.
* Activity, which are the six different activities captured during the original experiment and which are enumerated in the README.md file.
\* The remaining columns are the names of the measurement as defined in the original raw data but filtered per the steps outlined in README.md. The 561 original measurements were filtered for just those measurements of mean and standard deviation, resulting in 86 variables remaining, which are named appropriately. *The original variable names have been modified only for readability and consistency. See README.md for details.*

For each combination of Test\_Subject and Activity, set\_cast.txt the mean was calculated for each of the 86 variables. For example, rows 1-6 are the means of the 86 measurements for Test\_Subject 1, for each of his/her activities (e.g., WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS).
